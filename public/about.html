                  Our vision is to create a sustainable network of pantries
                  providing low-cost food and wrap-around services. The pantry
                  is a dignified approach empowering communities to help
                  themselves. The Pantry will support upskilling the community
                  through volunteering and employability opportunities, with the
                  shop itself being utilized as a training facility.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Scottish Pantry Network will support the pantries by being
                  the collective voice for change, we forge strong partnerships
                  to support the development of the hub model, creating a
                  tailored experience for local communities. The Network will
                  provide ongoing support to the pantries through compliance,
                  lobbying and creating links with food suppliers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  1. The prevention of poverty and the relief of financial
                  hardship by providing food security to those who need it most
                  and being disadvantaged due to unemployment, low income, lone
                  parent, health, and social standing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. The advancement of community development by acting on
                  behalf of the Network of Pantries, sourcing food to ensure
                  there is enough in the supply chain, lobbying government,
                  providing a regulatory function, and sharing best practice
                  across the Network.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. Advancement of environmental protection by reducing food
                  waste locally and nationally.
                </p>
                <p>
                  4. Advancement of education by Increasing access to skills,
                  training and employment prospects in relation to developing
                  and running a local pantry.
                </p>
                <p>
                  5. Advancement of health by improving health outcomes –
                  particularly around the consumption of fresh fruit and
                  vegetables, through social eating, improving emotional
                  wellbeing and social inclusion through Pantries acting as
                  community hubs, and by promoting access to nutritious meals
                  and increase fruit and vegetable consumption.
                </p>
                <p>
                  6. Relief for those in need by providing access to key support
                  such as money advice, credit unions, housing, health,
